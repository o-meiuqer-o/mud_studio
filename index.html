They also seem to struggle in keeping up with a conversation, the bot will help them with it by asking about their day and reminding them of their favorite things, to end up getting them into a conversation. People with dementia ask questions repeatedly, as humans, it becomes difficult to answer over again, but a bot will be able to repeat itself as many number of times. They also tend to forget things they enjoy, the bot can help by reminding them of their allergies and emergency contact shared by the user, in times of danger. People with anxiety can overcome it by talking to a virtual assistant, which can keep conversations confidential."

Organs you can donate include:  Internal organs: Kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs Skin Bone and bone marrow Cornea Most organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died. But some organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive.  People of all ages and background can be organ donors. If you are under age 18, your parent or guardian must give you permission to become a donor. If you are 18 or older you can show you want to be a donor by signing a donor card. You should also let your family know your wishes."

Luckily, in the age of the internet everything can be found within minutes, so went through all the different articles, statistics, and news reports to gather as much information as we can. We understood that 1 in every 5 adults experiences some sort of mental health issue and 1 in every 25 adults has severe effects on how they function daily. Then we went about interviewing ourselves and jotting down all the issues we faced in the past few years and how we reacted to them. Then we went on to interview a few people to get a vague idea about the situation in the general public. We then created a form to take a survey among the larger group of people and the results we got from the survey helped us to come to a general idea that about 40% of the people who are not comfortable in life are facing some sort of mental health issues and almost 80% of them didn't seek any professional help"

We filtered out some of them and chose the reason which was convenient to us, to work on it and chose ,toys from waste as a possibility to bring the change that is in our catch. As we researched, we got know that, dry waste can be used or molded into toys when worked on it. Cardboards, thermacols, used tins, some of the plastic wastes etc has been used to built toys. We could gather a lot of knowledge on wastes being produced in our country and all over the world. We got to know that, there are different types of wastes and has a large impact on the environment when left unconcerned.

What we were able to sense uptill now is that its not just that people are unaware of the need to manage waste but there are certain more important things that are holding them back to do so such as the amount of personal investment of money they need to make in order to segregate waste. But we can also say that there is a lot of unawareness, among the people or the organisations addressing this issue about efficient ways to manage waste. As this project onsets us on our journey to explore the cause(s), we want to give it out best to understand and come up with it, as only after we are able to uncover the cause(es) it would be easy for anyone to come-up with solutions."

For example, one may be needing an item under urgency, one would definitely then prefer going to a store that's within a walkable distance over ordering it online that might take 2-3 days to arrive. Not just this, online shopping for groceries can also be more expensive at times depending on the demand and delivery charges. Good packaging and quality of products ordered online may also not be assured. In case one's looking for perishable items like milk and curd, or even fresh fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, one has no other choice but to go to a nearby grocery store!"

On top of not enough machines, no proper adherence to the rules, frequent repairs etc were additional problems that came from the insufficiency that was there. We aim to solve that problem and bring a better, convenient laundry services to hostelers :) The solution we're looking for can be anything; from a mere website or an app to a whole new installation of laundromat or a better laundry service, so we're really looking forward to how the results turn out"

But this has also led to an increase in the negative impacts of development like pollution, water depletion, etc. and one such issue that has arised (mainly in the urban households) is food wastage. People are buying more than they consume and are taking the food they\u2019re eating for granted. Moreover, this food which turns into waste can be put into good use by feeding the people in need, just by eating consciously( knowing what and how much a person can eat ). We think we can bring a change in the thought process of people by just helping them realise the efforts and the resources that have been put in the making of these, and how it could\u2019ve been put to good use. This realisation can, we believe, drastically lower the amount of food that will be wasted. Also, because of technological advancements, the food which is inevitably wasted, is also being used to generate power. We think a proper supply-chain/system put in place which facilitates the transport of the waste to these companies can also help, as this food waste release harmful emissions and cause pollution. We are also trying to come up with a way to work with the orphanages so that this healthy food is not actually wasted. Though we are still working on more ideas, we think this will only work with the combined effort of all the people."

Rules to the Game of Marbles you can see a white circle on the board. Marbles are placed inside the circle, usually near the center. Taking a Turn  The player uses their shooter marble to take a turn. To shoot the marble typically a player will use their thumb to flick the marble from their hand putting their \"knuckles down\" onto the ground. The goal of each shot is to hit one of the marbles in the center and knock it out of the circle. If the player knocks a marble out, then they get to keep the marble for the rest of the game, they also get to take another turn. If no marble is knocked out of the circle, the other player then gets a turn then next shot can be taken from the spot where the shooter landed. Winning in Marbles  The player with the most marbles at the end of the game is the winner. Other options/rules:  If a player knocks the other player's shooter from the circle, then the shooter wins all the player's marbles they have won so far and that player is out of the game."

In mental health awareness there are many sub topics like mental health awareness for elders, mental health awareness for children,mental health awareness for adults etc. Since in the current world, though mental health issues are prevalent, it has been observed that 20% of adolescents may experience a mental health problem in any given year 50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 and 75% by age 24. 10% of children and young people (aged 5-16 years) have a clinically diagnosable mental problem, yet 70% of children and adolescents who experience mental health problems have not had appropriate interventions at a sufficiently early age.After surveying we decided that adolescents suffer the most. Adolescents face many problems like family issues,exam pressure,bullying,all types of abuse etc."

It is a structure that was built to produce civil servants, clerks and bureaucrats who could do the routine job. Not much has changed in the objective of our education system, even today. Now we have engineers being produced in bulk creating imbalance in the demand and supply in the job market. The same old rote learning mentality of students to score the highest marks, holds priority not only for the students but their guiding angels (parents and teachers). There is a thin line drawn between an educated and talented individual. Anyone with a first class degree is preferred over a hardworking and talented student, who scores in an average slot."

We had schools informing us that our tests and grades were still the most important things throughout what was without a doubt a time when everyone's mental health, especially students', worsened. There were no concessions or offers of assistance. The establishment claimed to be oblivious to students' problems all around the country. What should have been a lesson on mental health and empathy became something that reinforced the idea of life being short."

The device we use to convert that solar resource into usable electricity is a photovoltaic cell or simply, a solar cell. The solar cell, however, comes with limitations The average industrial efficiency of a solar panel is 15-20 percent. This means only about 15 to 20 percent of the energy received from the sun is being converted into electricity. Increasing the efficiency of solar panels is all our project is about. We employ non-invasive upgrades on solar cells/panels so that they give more net output and thus raising their total average efficiency."

It's not just a standard website with recommendations and information on locations to visit in Hyderabad; it's also a blog where people can explore and express their experiences there. So that you can not only hear other people's opinions, but also ask questions and get them answered.

Our initiative was motivated by the emotion felt by many people and which has been a developing problem in the young generation; Lonliness. Over a span of 4 weeks my groupmates and myself have tried to discern and distinguish about this feeling which causes the person discomfort and a sense of unhappiness. We have been surveying various groups and sectors of people, some of them i personally found really distressing. The voulunteers we had interviewed had tried their best to put their emotions into words and expressed their issues both physiologically and psychologically. We conducted a poll and found out majority of those who were lonely were between the ages of 18 to 40. In the end, i would like to say that the project we worked on had given me a chance to participate and made me aware of the daily life of ceratin individuals while helping me to overcome these circumstances myself and gain an understanding on this subject."

        "description": "We realized dust from construction sites is a rising problem of our generation. All of us have been exposed to a thick layer of dust which resulted in short-term troubles. One of our team members had first-hand experience with dust every day, for a few years.  This inspired us to take the problem seriously and find a solution to it.     Dust from construction sites causes pollution in the air. This has an adverse effect on the environment and health. As per the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) officials, 30 percent of air pollution is caused due to dust that emanates from construction sites.   It occurs mainly in construction sites and due to the unfollowing of rules issued by the government. Also, equipment to absorb dust is not observed anywhere. There is a rise in pollution when many activities are taking place at the same time without precautionary measures and it affects our health. The problem is big and it can be seen in the data in the case studies mentioned below. Still, no precautions are being taken."
