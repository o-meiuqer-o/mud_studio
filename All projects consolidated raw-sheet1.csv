The bot has been trained to console lonely, depressed and people with dementia, they can talk about anything possible to the bot and the bot will be there to listen to them, anytime. They also seem to struggle in keeping up with a conversation, the bot will help them with it by asking about their day and reminding them of their favorite things, to end up getting them into a conversation. People with dementia ask questions repeatedly, as humans, it becomes difficult to answer over again, but a bot will be able to repeat itself as many number of times. They also tend to forget things they enjoy, the bot can help by reminding them of their allergies and emergency contact shared by the user, in times of danger. People with anxiety can overcome it by talking to a virtual assistant, which can keep conversations confidential."

The most common thing we use plastic more is in toys and games. So now we decided to make toys and games out of waste. And to understand whether this will work or not we set up a stall in our campus. Where we arranged a few set of games that are made from random waste collected from our college. I guess this made our project successful. The response we got was soo good.

What we were able to sense uptill now is that its not just that people are unaware of the need to manage waste but there are certain more important things that are holding them back to do so such as the amount of personal investment of money they need to make in order to segregate waste. But we can also say that there is a lot of unawareness, among the people or the organisations addressing this issue about efficient ways to manage waste.

We came up with this idea just to resolve some of the issues that we all might be facing with online grocery shopping while on campus. For example, one may be needing an item under urgency, one would definitely then prefer going to a store that's within a walkable distance over ordering it online that might take 2-3 days to arrive. Not just this, online shopping for groceries can also be more expensive at times depending on the demand and delivery charges. Good packaging and quality of products ordered online may also not be assured. In case one's looking for perishable items like milk and curd, or even fresh fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, one has no other choice but to go to a nearby grocery store!"

Growth is taking place across all segments of the economy and the society. But this has also led to an increase in the negative impacts of development like pollution, water depletion, etc. and one such issue that has arised (mainly in the urban households) is food wastage. People are buying more than they consume and are taking the food they’re eating for granted. Moreover, this food which turns into waste can be put into good use by feeding the people in need, just by eating consciously( knowing what and how much a person can eat ). We think we can bring a change in the thought process of people by just helping them realise the efforts and the resources that have been put in the making of these, and how it could’ve been put to good use. This realisation can, we believe, drastically lower the amount of food that will be wasted. Also, because of technological advancements, the food which is inevitably wasted, is also being used to generate power. We think a proper supply-chain/system put in place which facilitates the transport of the waste to these companies can also help, as this food waste release harmful emissions and cause pollution. We are also trying to come up with a way to work with the orphanages so that this healthy food is not actually wasted. Though we are still working on more ideas, we think this will only work with the combined effort of all the people. "

Throughout the epidemic, which caused widespread mental pain and anxiety, schools and universities across the country had just one goal: to finish exams and submit all assignments on time. We had schools informing us that our tests and grades were still the most important things throughout what was without a doubt a time when everyone's mental health, especially students', worsened. There were no concessions or offers of assistance. The establishment claimed to be oblivious to students' problems all around the country. What should have been a lesson on mental health and empathy became something that reinforced the idea of life being short."

The device we use to convert that solar resource into usable electricity is a photovoltaic cell or simply, a solar cell. The solar cell, however, comes with limitations The average industrial efficiency of a solar panel is 15-20 percent. This means only about 15 to 20 percent of the energy received from the sun is being converted into electricity. Increasing the efficiency of solar panels is all our project is about. We employ non-invasive upgrades on solar cells/panels so that they give more net output and thus raising their total average efficiency."

573,ERROR 404,Space School,https://sites.google.com/view/spaceschool404/home,Ani Thomas,"offline/online (optional) tutoring platform. Elaborate model for onboarding new tutors onto the platform, mostly students looking for an internship alternative/ gain experience in skills they may already have acquired. As a tutor provides more tuitions, his/her reviews and ratings keep increasing. This enables the students to narrow down the best tutors. We cater to national audience, with students ranging from pre-primary to secondary schools, or even entrance preps. Working like a match maker between the tutors and students both being the young generation of the society. Only one other startup is somewhat close to the idea of our model, called  FlipClass . But this startup model is restricted by the means of appointing tutors as it accepts only 9/100 applications. Our model is open to all students that want to teach and earn and as we focus on pre primary to secondary edu, we follow a sort of pyramid theme where for eg. 12th grader can tutor a fifth grader i.e  the knowledge gap is big enough to ensure the tutor can and will be successful in his/her job. The student/their guardian and the tutor can negotiate one on one through a chat bot or direct communication and some percent of the total pay comes to as commission to the startup. Payment would be on a monthly/ half yearly basis. This type of model might face situations where once a tutor is matched with a student, they might start further external communication in order to avoid commission payment and to curb these type of problems we came up with an internship/experience certificate that is granted to tutors only if they provide tuitions through the startup and over a specific period of time say a year or two depending on the subject or course they teach."

This inspired us to take the problem seriously and find a solution to it.     Dust from construction sites causes pollution in the air. This has an adverse effect on the environment and health. As per the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) officials, 30 percent of air pollution is caused due to dust that emanates from construction sites.   It occurs mainly in construction sites and due to the unfollowing of rules issued by the government. Also, equipment to absorb dust is not observed anywhere. There is a rise in pollution when many activities are taking place at the same time without precautionary measures and it affects our health. The problem is big and it can be seen in the data in the case studies mentioned below. Still, no precautions are being taken."
